Notes:

KSP didn't work for HILT. Thus added Kapt for now.

These are dependencies on version with Kotlin and Hilt so if encountered such issues, 
check for supported version of Kotlin with Hilt compatibility.

Update: For now, you can use the newest version.

    Kotlin:1.9.0 - Hilt:2.48
    Kotlin:2.0.0 - Hilt:2.51.1

In future, will transition to KSP plugin.
